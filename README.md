# Welcome to the Apps wiki!

Everything in this page will explain how to start creating your own app, along with details on how to efficiently use all of DeskThing's features.

***⚠️THIS GUIDE ASSUMES YOU HAVE BASIC APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT KNOWLEDGE. DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT A TERMINAL IS. ⚠️*** (lol I'm going to probably edit this out later)


## How to start creating your app
1. This guide assumes you have node.js installed on your system. If not, install it [here](https://nodejs.org).
2. In a new terminal, run `npm create deskthing@latest`
3. Follow the instructions in the terminal when it is finished downloading.
